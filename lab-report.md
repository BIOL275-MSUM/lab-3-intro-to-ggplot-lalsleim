on the lab website.

## Fireflies

> A. Insert an R code chunk and create a graph depicting the frequency
> distribution of the 35 mass measurements. It should have legible text
> and appropriate axis labels.

\_\_\_

> B. What type of graph did you choose in part (A)? Why?

\_\_\_

> C. Describe the shape of the frequency distribution. What are its main
> features?

\_\_\_

> D. What term would be used to describe the largest measurement in the
> frequency distribution? You can refer to the lecture slides, your
> notes, or the textbook.

## Bird orders

I read the data using the code provided by the instructor. The dataset
is from the auk package and was originally named ebird\_taxonomy. I
converted it to a tibble, removed non-species taxa, and named the new
dataset birds.

    library(auk)                          # load the auk package
    birds <- ebird_taxonomy %>%           # start with the ebird_taxonomy data
      as_tibble() %>%                     # tibbles print better in the console
      filter(category == "species")       # remove non-species taxa

> E. How many bird species are in the new birds dataset? How did you
> find out?

\_\_\_

> H. How many orders are there? You can get this right by counting on
> the graph, but you will only get full points if you use some code to
> figure it out.

\_\_\_

> F. Insert an R code chunk and create a graph depicting the
> distribution of orders in the birds dataset. Sort the orders with the
> most frequent on the left. It should have legible text and appropriate
> axis labels.

\_\_\_

> G. What kind of graph did you create? Why?
